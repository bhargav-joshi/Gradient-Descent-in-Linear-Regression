# Gradient-Descent-in-Linear-Regression
Gradient Descent is the process of minimizing a function by following the gradients of the cost function. This involves knowing the form of the cost as well as the derivative so that from a given point you know the gradient and can move in that direction, e.g. downhill towards the minimum value.
